## 📚 Overview

The **Fake News Detection** project leverages machine learning to identify whether a news article is genuine or fake based on its content. By using techniques like **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **classification models**, this project helps to address the spread of misinformation.

### 🎯 Objective
The objective is to create a robust model that can accurately classify news articles as *fake* or *real* based on the text data.

## 🚀 Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fake-news-detection.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd fake-news-detection
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Streamlit app**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## ⚙️ Model Building Process

### 1. Data Preprocessing 🧹
- Clean the text data by removing punctuation, stop words, and performing stemming/lemmatization.
- Convert the text into a numerical format using techniques like **TF-IDF** or **Count Vectorization**.

### 2. Feature Engineering 🛠️
Key features include:
- **Text content**: The primary feature for classification.
- **TF-IDF vectors**: Numerical representation of text data.

### 3. Model Training 🤖
Several machine learning models were evaluated for fake news classification:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Random Forest**

### 4. Model Evaluation 🏅
The best model achieved:
- **Accuracy:** 92%
- **Precision:** 0.91
- **Recall:** 0.93
- **F1-Score:** 0.92
