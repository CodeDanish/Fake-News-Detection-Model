Fake News Detection Model

Overview:

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to detect fake news articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to create a system that can accurately classify news articles as either real or fake.

Features

- Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the text data by removing noise such as stop words and punctuations. Applied tokenization and stemming/lemmatization to standardize the text.
- Feature Engineering: Converted text data into numerical representations using techniques like TF-IDF and Word2Vec.
- Modeling: Implemented various machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest. Compared their performance to identify the most effective model.
- Evaluation: Evaluated the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The chosen model achieved an accuracy of XX% on the test data.
- Deployment: Deployed the model using Flask, allowing users to input news articles and receive real-time predictions on their authenticity.
